### Troubleshooting: Common Issues When Using Vanilla Gift Cards on Amazon

Despite being a straightforward process, some users may face issues while attempting to use their Vanilla Gift Cards on Amazon. Below are some of the most common problems and how to resolve them.

If Amazon doesnâ€™t accept your Vanilla Gift Card, check if:
